Simon Green, better known as Bonobo, is an english producer/DJ who has been active since before the turn of the millennium.

During this time, 
Bonobo started out doing trip hop so he learned his sampling style there.
These days he uses more world instruments and jazz(just in percussion?)
This gives his sound a unique character, and sets it apart from a lot of electronica.

When you sample something, you get to bring a slice of another musical culture into your own - you get to give it a new home.

How does the fact he's been at it since the 2000s come into play?
This is what he started out making
What tools does he use? Old school? He mentioned Ableton in song exploder.

Sampling plays a big role. Here's how.

Thankfully, we can get some insight into Simon's process from his episode on [Song Exploder](https://songexploder.net/bonobo).

Some of the techniques he mentions using are...


He speeds/pitches things up and down to give them an otherworldy character. 

He also uses found sounds to give things some ambience and space. The backing ambience in this track is from a train trip he took when he was living in Manhattan. 

He takes a drum break from a jazz player and use it to fill out the beat. - shows roots

Several of the sample loops used in Break Apart are pulled from old recording sessions or just out of his user library.

He uses snippets that aren't always right on the transient.
Possibly same recording session as break apart?



I should be collecting things to build up a solid user library.

In a song like Bambro Koyo Ganda, samples both make up one shot ear candy sounds to fill out the chorus or prop up a build, they also serve as the core percussion and vocals in the verses.
The outro of that song is almost entirely samples.




Conclusion...
Both the sound sources chosen and techniques used give Bonobo's sampling a unique flavour.
The practice he gets in situations like that plane ride where he started on Break Apart are what give him the skills.
He jumps around in genre and that gives him a better selection. 
Sampling gives these musical ideas a new purpose, a new story. They get to become more widely heard and creatively developed outside of the context of their creation, which raises the question:
