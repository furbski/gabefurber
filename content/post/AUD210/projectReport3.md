Bonobo started out doing trip hop so he learned his sampling style there.
These days he uses more world instruments and jazz(?)
This gives his sound a unique character, and sets it apart from a lot of electronica.



Another thing that gives his sound a unique character are the techniques he uses to shape it.
He uses vocal snippets that aren't always right on the transient.

He does [stuff you'll find out in that song exploder].

In a song like Bambro Koyo Ganda, samples both make up one shot ear candy sounds to fill out the chorus or prop up a build, they also serve as the core percussion and vocals in the verses.
The outro of that song is almost entirely samples.

“My own personal idea of identity has played into this record and the theme of migration,” Green adds. “Is home where you are or where you are from, when you move around?”
