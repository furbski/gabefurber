Write a blog post of at least 300 words where you analyse an electronic music artist’s approach to sampling in their music production
• Aim to find an artist whose work you can draw upon in your own EMP Remix project
• Analyse with reference to the era and genre with which this artist is associated
• Discuss aspects such as the equipment and sampling techniques used and what role sampling plays in their overall production style
• In your blog post link to a track by the artist which demonstrates the points you are discussing
• Be specific in your blog in pointing out where in the track we can hear the techniques you are pointing out
Note, this should be a different artist than the ones you have discussed in previous blog posts!
