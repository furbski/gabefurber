Simon Green, better known as Bonobo, is an english producer/DJ who has been active since before the turn of the millennium.

He is particularly good at using samples. 
This is important to me because when you sample something, you get to bring a slice of another musical culture into your own - you get to give it a new home.

He started out producing Trip Hop, and you can still hear the roots of that sound - his percussion is particularly reminiscent of the genre.

Trip Hop is a genre that is rooted in sampling, and he has remained [a prolific sampler](https://www.whosampled.com/Bonobo/) to this day.

His last few releases have drawn more heavily from jazz and world music.
This gives him a unique sonic character, and sets his work apart from a lot of electronic music - not that the idea is so groundbreaking, but the execution is exceptional. 

## How does he do it?

Thankfully, we can get some insight into Simon's process from his episode on [Song Exploder](https://songexploder.net/bonobo).

Some of the techniques he mentions using are pitch shifting audio up or down a few tones to give it an otherworldly character, using ambiences he collected himself on a train journey to give the track some air, and taking drum fills from old jazz records to fill out the space between his kicks and snares - clearly showing his Trip Hop roots. 
We can also hear that he doesn't always cut a sample right on the transient, sometimes he's using the tail end of a sound.

He mentioned that he pulled the harp loop into ableton while he was on a plane. This would suggest that he has a user library full of ideas that he can demo easily against different projects to see if they fit. A good reason to keep your musical ideas properly organised, so they can be used without digging around in old sets.

Both the sound sources chosen and techniques used give Bonobo's sampling a unique flavour.

The constant practice like on the plane is what gives him the skills. 
His jumping between genres broadens his selection. 

Sampling gives these musical ideas a new purpose, a new story. They get to become more widely heard and creatively developed outside of the context of their creation, raising the question:
