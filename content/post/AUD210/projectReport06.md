So we've started work on the multimedia project which will run until the end of trimester, concurrently with the studio project. I've made a simple Gantt chart (one of Notion's new features) to help keep organised and on schedule.

So far I'm looking forward to this project - the animation soundtracks seem fun, the ad is a good opportunity to do some creative sound design in a car ad or whatever, and the trailer is the perfect thing to practice tracking and syncing dialogue, composing to video, and cross platform collaboration - since I'll be writing in Ableton but the syncing and mixing will take place in ProTools.

We haven't totally figured out our trailer roles yet, but I've offered to write the score, Bonnie is the perfect fit for the lead actress and Andrew the duke, and Declan is probably going to mix. The rest of the sub projects are less collaboration focused, so the division of labour is yet to be determined. 

Here's a link to our [Trello](https://trello.com/b/4gOlE8eZ/big-team-multimedia-project).

Obviously this plan isn't going to be followed perfectly. Some things will be done sooner or later than anticipated, and we'll need to be agile. Even if it is destroyed on contact with reality, I find a plan like this gets me thinking in the long term.
