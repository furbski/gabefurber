# Here we are.

Now lets see if this is working properly.

I couldn't find the stylesheet to edit. Turns out it was pulling from the master repository. Good for getting updates, but I want to customise.

Forked it, and redeployed with netlify. So far so good. Now I just need to see if this is actually going to add to the proper directory. I've even added a folder to make things more difficult, which may be a bad idea. We'll see.

Of course, I could still do this manually with markdown and Git, but I like the convenience of this CMS thing, primarily with images. It's lacking in other ways though, such as automatic date/time selection.

Time to see how it works.
