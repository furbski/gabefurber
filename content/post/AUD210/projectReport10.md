We're currently in the swing of working on our soundalike project, and the other day we had the privilege of recording drums with [Ryan Haus](https://www.instagram.com/ryanhausdrums/). He was a consummate professional and a pleasure to work with, which was handy because we had a few hiccups in the studio.

My primary role was as the producer, which entailed communicating with the artist, logging the best overall takes, the sections which would need to be comped, and the best fills and variations. This part of the job went pretty well, but I did learn something very important which I'll touch on later. And while I might have gotten the job done, my method was terrible. I ended the day with a bunch of inconsistent and nigh incomprehensible scribbles in my notebook, rather than a clean framework for the work to come. 

What I should have done is make a table in my notes with each take having an indication of the quality of the individual sections

This would allow me to see at a glance that take 2 was the best, and that I need to comp verse 2 from take 1, then intro and pre 2 from take 3.

This wasn't possible because my computer was being used for the communications with the ProTools operation room, but the more fundamental issue is that the session wasn't properly prepared. There were no section markers. I had to go by bar number, which is much less intuitive and prone to error. Not only that but the tempo hadn't been mapped, so we needed to spend a lot of valuable studio time trying to line up a transient with a click when we could have been learning about the desk in front of us, the patch bay signal flow, experimenting with outboard effects, and so on. 

However, the most gut wrenching moment was when Ryan came on the comms and said "the arrangement is wrong". I had no idea what was different, or what the severity of the issue would be. We didn't have the time or resources to book another session, so the consequences could have ranged from a whole lot of comping and editing to a complete rebuilding of the drums in a kit made out of one shots we recorded. Thankfully it was on the mildest end of the spectrum, just two bars dropped from the first chorus, but an easily preventable error resulted in confusion, loss of time, and a clear sense of unprofessionality.

It was not all doom and gloom, however. Our mic choice and placement was well thought out, our outboard gear did exactly what we wanted, we tweaked a few things on the way in that would have been impossible to fix in post, and we got a lot of good material. All these things resulted in us pulling some good fucken drums.

After we fixed the project and sorted out our arrangement troubles, we built a good rapport with Ryan, and he gave me some excellent, albeit simple advice:

When an artist is behind the glass with their headphones on and they're waiting to get instruction, it can be a very isolating experience. They have no idea what's going on in the studio, why they're waiting, or what you're talking about. The lot of artists are pretty insecure - you don't want them to start over thinking and ruminating. So, just be on the mics. Inform them of whatever the issue is with ProTools, keep them in the loop with the creative process, or just tell them what a great take that last one was. This helps them feel comfortable and confident in what they're doing, and in turn will result in a better performance most of the time. Different personalities will require a different touch, but unless you're dealing with someone who's had enough success to dramatically inflate their ego, a comforting, encouraging approach will likely work best.
