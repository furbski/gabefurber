The multimedia project has been going pretty good so far, the ads are done, the trailer only needs a final mix, and the animations have strong drafts underway. 
I went into this project hoping to get some experience writing music and doing sound design for other mediums. I wrote the score for the trailer, synced dialogue and SFX for the ad, and made environmental sounds for two very distinct animations, so I'd say this was a success. I'm still working on the music and sound effects for the game, too, since the delivery on that is further in the future. 

The process I followed was pretty straight forward:

For the trailer and ad, we booked the studio and recorded dialogue first. I definitely think that was the right call, since it informed a lot of the trailer scoring process in ways that I wouldn't have expected. 

Writing music is usually an exploration that could go any direction, but for this I found myself constrained by what was happening on screen. Certain things that would have made sense musically were just not an option audio-visually. I solved this by sitting down at the keyboard and playing along for a few takes until I had a good selection of ideas that would go with the story.

I found the most difficult part of the scoring process to be turning that emotional colour pallete into a cohesive piece. In a few instances I had absolutely no idea how to get from one idea to another, but with enough trial and error I managed to stitch them together and the rest of the project flowed very naturally after that.

The interplay of dialogue and background sound in the ad wasn't as important since there was basically just a drone and a few sound effects that didn't clash with speech. In that piece I did a rough pass of SFX and 'music' first, but I think either way would have worked fine. 

I took a lot of care in syncing the dialogue to the movement of the mouth on screen, with one phrase needing to be cut up into individual phonemes and completely retimed. I think it was worth it for the realism.

Unfortunately I didn't have another actor to do the second character, so I just repitched my voice down about a tone. Not very convincing but at least the people on screen are distinguishable.

The animation soundtracks were a much more freeform job. There's very little limitation on what an evil scientist's lab sounds like, so experimentation was key. I put a recording of my dishwasher going nuts into a granular synth, used bizarre warping settings on a recording of a loud computer fan, and ran morse code through some effects. Why not? 

The medieval tower was more straight forward. I imagined it was in a forest, ergo forest sounds. It needed something musical, ergo medieval music. Well, soon there will be music for that one.

The website was also pretty fun to make.

Overall, I'm happy with this project. Many things could have been improved but it was a success on the whole.
