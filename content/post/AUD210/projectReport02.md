I was recently fortunate enough to stumble upon a new musical fascination.

Daniel Goldstein, aka Lane 8, is a producer who started making waves back in 2015 and has been on a steady climb since. He's a modern melodic house artist, signed to Anjunadeep - complete with a sound distinct to the label. 

This guy is really good at making a simple melodic idea sound interesting and dynamic with the use of automation and modulation in the form of envelopes and LFOs. 

Not only that, he chooses parameters that lead to a warm, analog sound, [despite primarily using software synthesizers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_eGfgCzQis&t=237).

Here's how he does it. 



## Parameters
In analog hardware synthesis the chaotic, unstable, and organic sound comes for free. No such luck in the digital environment. Thankfully there's a few key things you can change to get the desired tone.

Take a listen to a recent track - Yard Two Stone, on the Brightest Lights LP from January this year.

Right from the start you can hear some crunchy saturation on the chords - distortions reminiscent of the sound of magnetic tape exceeding it's volume capacity. This sounds to me like a Wurli that's been completely crushed.
Accompanying that is some subtle pitch oscillation on the lead synth, another mimicry of the shortcomings of older media.
It's worth noting there's also some saturation on the vocals and some background synth elements. This is probably an effect on a send, not a setting within the synth itself, but it alters the waveform all the same.

During the intro, there's a few moments where you can hear the comb filtering probably caused by a slight detune that emulates oscillator drift in a hardware synth. 

It's also worth noticing that the synths are filtered a fair bit in the high end, akin to how old recording and playback methods would have changed the character.
Filtering - hi/low shelf EQ can replicate the loss of certain frequencies caused by old 

Noise - probably feels similar to tape hiss and vinyl crackle - nostalgic. Modern hardware isn't noisy, even analog.


## Modulation
He says in that interview that he likes to start with a simple arp.

As is convention in the this style of music, the actual composition isn't very complex. The entire track hangs on the modulation of the synth sounds, particularly the lead arp. Getting variable levels of reverb, decay times, delay sends, cutoff frequency, and so on.

So it needs to be compelling.

This collaboration from August with Yotto, an artist that exists in a similar niche as Lane 8, showcases just how much this genre hangs itself from synthesis.

The melody is a repetetive, catchy ostinato with a few variations. It has a kind of hypnotic effect to repeat the same melody for an entire track, but to prevent it from becoming maddening it needs to be constantly moving and evolving. It manages to remain sonically dynamic as filters, sends, envelopes, and other parameters automate, and it maintains musical interest by constantly changing relationship to the bass, harmony, and other melodic elements.

This kind of music goes through a journey and evolution as you listen.
