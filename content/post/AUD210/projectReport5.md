As mentioned in the [previous post](../projectreport4/), I've been making a remix of a classmate's unreleased track in the style of Tropical House. Here's the final product.

This was a fun song to make and I learned a lot in the process, through examining the reference tracks, exploring related genres and labels, and of course the production process itself.

## Inspiration

While I started out listening to Tropical House as inspiration, I quickly found other styles that I liked more. My favourite has to be Melodic House, a Deep House subgenre that sits at the triple point between what I like to make, what I like to listen to, and what the mystical 'audience' likes.

I particularly found the label [Anjunadeep](https://anjunadeep.com/) to have an inspiring sound. I think if I could do it again, I would make this remix more in the style of deep/melodic house to capitalise on the things that I like about that sound. 

Either way, this is a Trop House track. Trying to make something in this subgenre just felt inauthentic and cheesy at first. Almost none of what I write is so upbeat - not to imply I only make sad music, but it's almost never a four chord major scale situation. Despite the fact that it felt weird at the start, it was fun once I got into the groove of it, and I don't think I'll have nearly as much reservation next time a project like this presents itself. 

However, I think the commitment to this style compromised the sonic quality of the song in some regards. Too much reverb, too many finger snaps, cliché rainmaker sounds, and so on, but it wasn't all bad. I think the steel drum and crashing waves are some of the best parts of the song, and the idea probably wouldn't have come if I wasn't thinking within the confines of the genre.

## Process

Like I said, this style is outside of my realm of experience, so finding a process that worked for me was trail and error.

I started by listening to and taking notes on the songs and styles I was referencing, seeing which parts I liked, which parts were iconic, and which weren't for me. 

Then I started writing stuff.

I wanted to get more practice with live view, so I started out by putting a few different loops of the original into a set, followed by a 4 on the floor kick and a simple sine bass. 

I heard in one of the reference tracks (electric feel) that the kick had a highpass filter on that opened up as the intro progressed. I wanted to do that, so I selected a sample with a lot of high frequency content as well as low end weight

Then I made a wavetable patch to emulate a steel drum.

{{< rawhtml >}}

	<p></p>

This was pretty close to what I wanted but it was too clearly synthetic, so I loaded up simpler with a real steel drum sample, mapped it to the correct pitch, and ran the midi from the wavetable channel into it.

It felt a bit thin when transposed an octave up, but got lost when playing at the same pitch as the synth, so I doubled it Chord.

I resampled some individual drum hits from the original, loaded them into a rack, and programmed a dem bow riddim.

This core idea evolved into the chorus/drop in the final track.

As things progressed, I added more variations and elements, such as the top line from the original,  a more rhythmically complex steel drum part, and recorded some nice sparkly subtractive saw chords on my Prologue.

I added a string part to give it some tension and used granulator to turn the carbonated fizz from the intro of the original into a pseudo vinyl crackle, but both got cut.

Many iterations later, I had done most of the processing and tweaking that ended up on the final instruments, but I was losing focus in live view and not making any decisions about arrangement. This is when I began analyzing reference tracks.

Soon enough I had figured out the arrangement I wanted and began work on stitching everything together.

For some reason wavetable was using an exceptional amount of CPU, so I started freezing it to prevent crackles and stuttering as the set became more complex. 

Oh yeah, and I remembered you can put instruments in a rack so I did that to lower track count.

Pretty soon I had finished production and started mixing.


{{< rawhtml >}}

	<p></p>
{{< /rawhtml >}}

When I'm producing my own stuff, I tend to mix as I go - adding distortion and transient control to help the steel drums cut through, sending various elements to reverbs to give it a sense of space, adding fades to samples so they don't clash with preceding or following parts, and so on. So when I say I had started mixing, I simply mean I did not allow myself to make any more production decisions. I find this helps to prevent stagnation and lets me focus on the overall track, polishing what I have, even if it's a turd. 

I tend to mix in arrangement view for a few reasons:

1. I'm already so familiar with the track in this format, it would throw me for a loop to completely switch paradigms when it came time to mix. Though I suppose that could help me hear it with new ears, so to speak.
2. Dynamics control is so much easier to do when you can just add a utility and automate the gain. Using compressors or gates can work, but it's fiddly and slow which gets in the way of the creative process and increases ear fatigue. You can also perfectly time fades to start or end on a specific bar.
3. It lets me focus on using my ears rather than watching faders. I still periodically check to see if anything has clipped.

Also I checked the mix on different headphones, speakers, and my phone, which prompted me to bring out some harmonics in the bass at certain points so it would still be audible on tinny speakers.



Thus the track is done, and I sent it off to Obert for some feedback.

He liked it, which makes me feel good. I really tried to be faithful to the original while still attending to the tropical house framework and my own tastes. Leaving relatively untouched snippets of the original, using his voice in the chorus, and incorporating the topline were all very deliberate decisions to make to feel like a remix, and not just inspired by the original.

I was also glad to hear that Nick didn't think it wasn't too cheesy.



## Further thoughts


I think the quality of my work is approaching the point where I'd be happy to release it. That would entail some discussion with Obert about copyright and royalties, if those things are even applicable. I truly have no idea what would be a fair agreement.

Regardless, if this song makes it onto an album, there's a few things I'd change.

First, the bass was changed at the last minute because I thought it was just too boring to keep exactly the same progression throughout the song, but in my continued listening to this style, there's some great songs with bass that plays but a single note for their entirety. I wouldn't take it to that extreme, but I'd be more confident in the artistic choice to keep it simple.

I would also change some minor details, like the percussion samples I layered in the intro. They're just not doing it for me on repeat listens. I also would want to give the flow of the track more attention. The first drop comes in very abruptly, and there's just nothing there, really. The melody in that part could certainly use some more interest, and would probably be the first thing I change.

Then there's the mix - a washy, overcompressed mess. Vocals aren't forward enough, there's far too much reverb on everything, and there's no dynamics at all. In my pursuit of the reference tracks and a 'radio ready' mix, whatever that means, I lost sight of the music.

I'm not going to change these things now, because I could tinker away on one song for the rest of my life and never be completely satisfied. This is a problem for future, more experienced me.

Besides, there's a reason people say to get "quality through quantity", or to "move fast and break stuff". There's nothing more beneficial to your abilities than deliberate practice, which must be applied to the whole process, start to finish.

Today I look back at the first stuff I made, and find it hilariously quaint and unimpressive. I'm sure I'll do the same with this song in a few years time. 

That guy will know what to do.
