First genuine reflection in this new format. Exciting.

I've be tasked with writing on how I rate myself in the areas of self reflection and deliberate practice.

### Self Reflection.

It's a hard question to answer objectively. If my self reflection is bad then I'll have a hard time knowing it.


* I think I''m well organised in a way that allows for some easy self reflection.
* Going back over my journal entries is a tool I find useful 
* I organise my thoughts into pretty comprehensive notes, and it becomes obvious when one part of my practice isn't flourishing because there's not nearly as much.
* I find it natural to write as a way of clarifying my thoughts.
* I've maintained a journal for a long time
* 




Overall I think I'm pretty good at self reflection.
The problem is putting that into action.


### Deliberate Practice

* There are so many things I have an interest in that I fall short of giving any of them the attention they deserve - laying a 100 bricks over different houses and building nothing.



## Pre Mortem

So we've been doing a lot of post mortems on these projects and how they go, but surely it would be more useful to know what the issues will be so you can prevent them from ever happening.

I feel like I'm not going to have much trouble with the electronic music production aspect, because that's my favoured area. This may just be hubris, since I'm not entirely sure how I'll fare in a genre matching style.

The multimedia project should be interesting. I'm interested in doing sound for games, so this would be a good area to try that out. I could use my newfound unity knowledge (thanks audio masterclass!) and collaborate with one of the games students on a little project. Maybe Luke. That way it would be a truly interactive experience and directly related to my desired profession - making good portfolio fodder.
This could very well be an issue. Wouldn't be the first time I had eyes bigger than my stomach. More software means more complexity means more points of failure. Also there's more rabbit holes for me to go down and lose track of the big picure.

I'm not sure about the studio production project. Haven't read the guide on that one. I don't know as much about studio stuff as I do with electronic music, so I would expect some issues.



Of course there's the non project areas I expect to have some issues with. Lockdown isn't a peach for anyone, and I find that it paradoxically makes me self isolate more, skipping class and so on.

[more shit about how much of a lazy fuck I am]


Pre mortem: 

What are the things that might go wrong?
How could they go wrong?
How could you avoid it?


## Planning Ahead

Knowing this, how should I spend the 20 hours a week I need to for this class?

I'm going to have to force my way into consistency with the relfection and stuff. I have these new systems that I want to try out which will make it easier in the long term but are going to have some switching costs.

I should spend a fair few hours researching the concepts behind the tools and techniques I'll be using.

Watching tutorials and readind documentation is a good way to familiarise yourself with something you don't understand.


I also need to get in some reps to get good with this stuff.

For the style matching thing, I ought to try it out on a few songs before or alongside the project.




The particular area I honestly think I should be focusing on the most is just sitting down and writing.

Starting with something easy like a plan for any given topic or project is a good way to get momentum behind actually doing the work.



I think I typically have trouble with the consistency aspect of it. I don't know how best to overcome that.
