I've been working on a remix for Nu Flava's(?) track Summertime the last few weeks. 

-- Include a link to the original track here when available --

I'm turning this into something in the vein of Tropical House, since it felt thematically appropriate. Here's how it has been going.



## Current progress
I've taken the vocals from the chorus, and the drum track. I've made a simpler instrument out of the chorus vox because there was a few held notes that would loop well. The chorus felt closer to the style of vocals you would hear in a tropical house track.

It's a shame all the instruments and drums were on a single stem, because I would have liked to slice up everything in minute detail, but instead I've just taken chunks of the beat, filtered and sidechained, and used as background element in some sections.

I've been working in session view, which is not how I usually work. I wanted to get some practice in the format I would need to use to perform live. I feel like it has slowed me down, however. I'm used to seeing a song as a start to finish entity, not as a collection of scenes. 

Although, I have gotten far more comfortable in session view - so that was a success - and I've built up a fair few scenes that are a strong foundation for the song structure.



## What's next?
I still have to arrange and mix the song. As a by product of working in session view, the mix has gotten more attention than the arrangement, so that will take the majority of the remaining work.

I have to print my follow actions and automation, then go through adding fills, transitions, and ear candy.

I haven't had any discussion with Obert yet - I'll need to make sure he's happy with the direction and progress.



## Reference material
I'm aiming for something with a similar vibe to Electric Feel, but not exactly.

I'll also draw inspiration Nora En Pure's remix of Packard.

I found this video about synth plucks quite helpful for designing the steel drum sound.
