I've been working on a remix for Nu Flava's track Summertime[Link]. Here's how it has been going.

-- Include a link to the original track here --

I'm making a tropical house track, since I felt like it fit the theme and is adjacent to some genres I very much enjoy. 
I'm aiming for something with a similar vibe to Electric Feel, but not exactly.

I've taken the vocals from the chorus, and the drum track. I've made a simpler instrument out of the chorus vox because there was a few nicely held notes that would fade together well. The chorus felt closer to the style of vocals you would hear in a tropical house track.
It's a shame all the instruments and drums were on a single stem, because I would have liked to slice up everything in minute detail, but instead I've just taken chunks of the beat, filtered and sidechained, and used as background element in some sections.

I've been working in session view, which is not how I usually work. I wanted to get some practice in the format I would need to use to perform live. I feel like it has slowed me down, however. I'm used to seeing a song as a start to finish entity, not as a collection of scenes. 
I haven't had any conversation with Obert. I should do that.

Some resources I've found useful in this project are...
