Due to covid, it's a little different at the moment. Instead of choosing our own track to recreate, we had to choose from the catalogue of previous trimesters. We went with Californication, by the Red Hot Chilli Peppers (if you were somehow unfamiliar with the tune).

The song follows a classic Verse - Chorus - Bridge structure with three choruses, the first being shortened by two bars in our version.

The instrumentation is pretty basic with guitar, drums, bass, and vocals, all of which are present for almost the entirety except the vocals, which take a break during the guitar solo. There's also some cheeky organ at the start of the verses, before the vocals start. You could call these sections interludes I suppose.

This track is pretty much peak Loudness War times, so there's almost no dynamics. Just a big distorted sausage.

While pretty rhythmically basic, it's more interesting than a common time boots & cats beat - during the verses, the second kick of each bar is played on 3& rather than 3. It does return to ol' faithful during the chorus and pre: kicks on 1&3, snares on 2&4, hats on 8th notes in between. However, there's some nice fills to break up the monotony and the guitar plays some syncopated patterns in the verse too.

For most of the track, the chords are Am, C, Dm, F, G. Since it's in A minor (which is convenient for the approximately 20 seconds of keys in this track), that means the chords are i, III, iv, VI, VII.

The progression in the verse is: I-VI, I-VI, III-VII-VI-iv-i-VI.
The pre is the same as the first two bars of the verse: I-VI, I-VI, I-VI, I-VI.
The chorus is similar to the end of the verse: III-VII-iv-i, III-VII-iv, III-VII-iv-i, III-VII-iv-i-VI.

Phew, what a mouthful.

These chords are actually great to play on the keys. Am is only one note away from Fmaj7, and if you play Am/E-Fmaj7-Am7-Fmaj7 then you only have to move your thumb one key at a time.

During the solo the key changes to what I believe is E mixolydian, playing F#m, D, F#m, D, Bm-D, A-E. This would make the chord progression: ii,VII,ii,VII,v-VII,VI-I. 

This also plays nicely, requiring very little movement from F#m to D(1st inv.), or Bm(2nd inv.), to D(1st inv.), to A(2nd inv.), to E.

The sung melody is pretty simple and catchy, just moving in small steps (no larger than a 4th) between the tonic, mediant, subdominant, and dominant in every section except the pre chorus, where it visits the supertonic a few times. 

As for the production of the track, it's dead simple. Almost everything in mono, next to zero time based FX. If there's reverb I can't hear it, though I suspect there's some room on at least the snare and vocals to make it feel like it's in a space. There's certainly compression, limiting, and more compression. It's loud.

It's got a pretty bittersweet vibe, though. The lyrics and vocal performance are some of the biggest contributors, as well as the key and chord progression. The hook of the song is almost entirely moving downwards too, which helps with that.

That's what I can hear at least - I don't know what technology is used except the broadest strokes. 
I clearly haven't developed my technical critical listening skills as much as my musical ones - though it helps to have a keyboard in front of you.
