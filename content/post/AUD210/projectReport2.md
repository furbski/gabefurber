Lane 8 (aka Daniel Goldstein)

uses fantastically analog, round, thick, sounds in this track.
 The arp and bass are particularly lush.
 The bass glides from note to note, growling all the way

 The pluck sound sounds like it has a number of variables mapped to an envelope that modulates their intensity, giving the sound a rich and complex hit with a smoother and more musical tail. 
 As is convention in the genre, the actual composition isn't very complex. The entire track hangs on the modulation of the synth sounds, particularly the lead arp. Getting variable levels of reverb, decay times, delay sends, cutoff frequency, and so on.

 Around the second drop? at 4:20, the bass modulates as well, changing to a buzzier, slighty brighter sound, with some pitch instability that sounds like a simulated tape effect.

I'm surprised to hear this, frankly. 
My assumption was that you would never want to detune the sub like that because it was make the whole composition start to fall apart, but it simply added to the tone. 
I never noticed until I critically listened to this track.





He says he mostly uses soft synths:
Arturia, Massive, or Sylenth

This interview was recorded in 2015 and the track is from 2018, so it's possible his workflow has changed, but I suspect that he's just gotten good at making a soft synth sound analog.


He says in that interview that he likes to start with a simple arp.
The one in the song he demos at 6:00 is just a sawtooth with some white noise in sylenth. (and a pitch LFO that changes in speed)

He writes a simple arpeggio and moves the bass notes around that to make interesting chords.

He mentioned adding an ambience track. In the case of that song, he mentions a recording in a train station. Something that just adds a little spice and randomness to give your ear something non-looping and organic. So you're not sitting there thinking "Yep, that's an 8 bar loop". He uses a simple delay with one channel 25ms after the other to add width using the hass effect, so that it doesn't get in the way of the kick or bass, which are typically right down the middle. 

It's especially nice when there's just kick and bass. Still gives you something up in the high end.


"When there's not a lot going on, it's good to help people find a downbeat sometimes"

Give reversed samples a little spice so they don't sound like a sample.

Use analog to make a white noise sweep. You can draw in a pattern rhymically so it's a little more interesting.

If you're using a very subby kick, make sure the bass is going above it.



Try not to reveal the whole thing on the first section. If you're writing drums, leave the 2 & 4 free. Don't play the full melody until the big reveal where everything is working together

Try out the Electric instrument in ableton




He only uses two sends: a room reverb and a saturator/compressor. Just distorts and compreses a bit.
Using only one reverb makes the music sound like it's all in the same place

You need to be competetive in volume.

Add little fills to the rides. play them on different midi notes so they're pitched down.

"Everything needs to be moving - not in a distracing, look at me way, but in a way that makes it an interesting experience."

"I hate when it's like 1, 2, 3, 4, New element."
If there's an offbeat highhat coming in, start it at the 4th beat of the bar before.
       
It's a good idea to keep a sidechain going even if there's no kick playing, so that when it does come back in, it's not jarring. You're not listening to a sound and then it lurches away.

Start ducking a few beats before the kick comes back in.

His bass in that track is at -18! All the energy is coming from the kick so he doesn't want to mess with it.

If your bass is going down, add an element that goes up.

The last chorus should be the biggest. 
It's hard to keep building in intensity if you don't add any new elements.
In the last chorus, add a new harmonic or melodic element and the 2 & 4 you left off earlier





Lane 8 vocal processing chain: low cut, compression, eq out nasty frequencies

Master buss processing
in this track he adds 2db of ~ 9k.
Density (free saturator/compressor), on medium-fast settings with the drive on 1/6th 
And a limiter so he doesn't blow his speakers.











Write a blog post of at least 300 words where you examine an electronic music artist’s approach to synthesis in their music production
• Aim to find an artist whose work you can draw upon in your own EMP Remix project
• Analyse with reference to the era and genre with which this artist is associated, with a particular emphasis on how they are using synthesis in their music
• Discuss aspects such as the equipment and synthesis techniques used and what role synthesis plays in their overall production style
• In your blog post include a link to a track by the artist which demonstrates the points you are discussing
• Be specific in your blog in pointing out where in the track we can hear the techniques you are pointing out
Note, this should be a different artist than the one you discussed in your previous blog post!
