I was recently fortunate enough to stumble upon Lane 8.

[Brief description]

This guy is really good at making a simple melodic idea sound interesting and dynamic with the use of automation and modulation in the form of envelopes and LFOs.

Not only that, he chooses parameters that lead to a warm, analog sound, [despite primarily using software synthesizers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_eGfgCzQis).

So, here's how he does it. 

## Parameters

Take a listen to the synths in this section [Timestamp]

This track is a good demonstration of the way he makes dusty, crunchy, fuzzy synth sounds.

He says in that interview that he likes to start with a simple arp.
The one in the song he demos at 6:00 is just a sawtooth with some white noise in sylenth. (and a pitch LFO that changes in speed - vibrato)





He's a modern melodic house artist, signed to Anjunadeep - with a sound distinct to that label. 


## Modulation

Altas???
Just - on brightest lights has a fucking sick vocal melody & melodic line.

As is convention in the this style of music, the actual composition isn't very complex. The entire track hangs on the modulation of the synth sounds, particularly the lead arp. Getting variable levels of reverb, decay times, delay sends, cutoff frequency, and so on.

So it needs to be compelling.

At [TIMESTAMP] you can hear [THING]
and at [ANOTHER] you can hear [OTHER STUFF]


Because that's what lane 8 does with his synths. He makes them come alive.
He chooses one melodic idea and plays it over all kinds of different stuff to make different vibes. He keeps it from getting stagnant by keeping it moving constantly.

I'm going to make use of his modulation to make my track sound alive.








## Conclusion


Which roles does synthesis play in his productions?

Era and genre as it relates so synthesis!
