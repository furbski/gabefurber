Project management is a key element in the role of an audio professional. The success of a production is directly related to the execution of a project plan.

You have been hired to produce and manage a large scale recording project by a vocalist. You have a demo, and are ready to enter the production phase. Propose a hypothetical production and account for all associated costs throughout the project lifecycle. Account for at least a rhythm section (drums, bass, guitar) to accompany your vocalist in your recording, but feel free to take this further.

In your plan, investigate, source and budget for:
-Session musicians
-Studio Hire
-Catering?
-Recording Engineer / Mixing Engineer
-Mastering
-Producer fees
-Distribution (digital/analogue)
-Contracts / Agreements
-Copyright (songwriting / sound recording) / Intellectual property rights

Present a breakdown of associated costs on your learning journal, with a description of the contractual agreements which will be in place. Provide URLs as sources for costs related studio/musicians/mastering etc.
